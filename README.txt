MovieList 
by Marina Neumann

This program practices using C++ implementation of data structures and classes to establish a database of movies. It will use external data file as well as client interactions to forulate the organization of movies. 

Thoughts about data structures:
**POTENTIAL OPTION**

-Linear linked list of linked lists, a linear linked list of alphabet, where each  letter node holds a list of all movies of that letter. 

-Other options:
-Favorites Organizer/Category Sorting
-Random selection to decide which movie to watch next. 
-Directory wil hold all movies, specifiying if watched, and if watched what they were rated/ is it belong in favorite category. 

This ADT will have some client side application but fundamentally working on building data structures and exploring this design idea to applied later (probably in Java & Angular, also maximizing backend and frontend w/ app/website application)
